    <h2><ins>Description</ins></h2>
    <p>The fruit of the prickly pear cactus (often called 'cactus fig' or 'tuna,') is sweet and juicy. Coupled with lime and frozen, it makes a light, refreshing summer treat. You can find cactus fig at any Mexican grocery and at some gourmet markets.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cactus figs</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>Â½ cup white granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh lime juice</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Remove the outer skin of the cactus figs to expose the light green flesh. Push the flesh through a mesh sieve into a bowl, collecting the juice and trapping the seeds and pulp.</p></li>
        <li><p>Combine water and sugar in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, stirring frequently until thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat; allow to cool slightly, about 15 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Stir cactus juice and lime juice into the sugar water. Mix thoroughly; chill for 1 hour.</p></li>
        <li><p>Pour cactus-lime mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer's instructions, about 20 minutes. Transfer to an airtight container and freeze until firm, about 4 hours.</p></li>
    </ol>
